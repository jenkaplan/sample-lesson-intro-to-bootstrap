# What is Bootstrap?
Bootstrap was created by Twitter to allow Web Developers to easily add beautiful styles to websites.

## How do you use Bootstrap?
1. Create your HTML file.
2. Download Bootstrap and link the files in the HTML or link directly to the Bootstrap website.
	* I recommend you download the files since that will work even when you are not connected to the internet.
3. Go to the Bootstrap website and look at their styles. 
4. After you choose a style you want to impliment, add a class to your HTML and then add the Bootstrap style class listed on the website.
